# generic-tower-defense

A tower defense game I made for a school project. Inspired by Bloons Tower Defense.

There are 6 waves, each introducing a new enemy that tries to break into your base. Your goal is to defend your base by adding towers to stop the enemies from reaching the end of the path. You lose hitpoints each time an enemy reaches your base. However, you can gain money after defeating each enemy and surviving a wave. There will a boss in the last wave, and you win by defeating it.

Each tower has different a range and damage output, while enemies have different speed and hitpoints. Game difficulty affects the map layout and amount of money earned per wave.
